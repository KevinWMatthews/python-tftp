I have issue mocking socket.socket.sendto(). If I use @patch.object(socket.socket, 'sendto'), it raises an AttributeError exception saying that sendto is read-only. I think that sendto is implemented in C and that this causes issue.
So, instead of just mocking a hidden interal attribute, I'll take the object-oriented approach and pass a socket object into the Client.

The server can resend a single packet if it does not receive an ack in response.
TFTP is designed to be implemented on top of the Datagram protocol (UDP).

Client          Server
______________________
Read    -->
        <--     Data 1 (< 512 K)
Ack     -->
        <--     Data 2
Ack     -->

Looks like port 69 is used to initiate a transmission but the data exchange takes place on a different port.
This is called the 'tid': Transmission ID. It simply consists of the port that is used for data transfer.
