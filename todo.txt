Add server retries to test list.

For block number failure in client read:

# print 'Received wrong block number! Expecting 1 but got %s' % block_number
The block number is an unprintable character. How can I display the hex code?

Can we import the opcodes from the class?

Do we need to sanitize the data portion of the packet in client.read()? For example, do we send an ack if we receive a packet that is < 512K? I'm pretty sure.

__parse_response_packet() probably needs a try statement.
Should we move input sanitation into __parse_response_packet()? We can't because we won't always expect the same opcode or block number.

Misc:

# There is something funky with the list of arguments. I have to create it all at once with the tuples?

Do we want to try to verify the console output of client read failures? Probably not.
Do we want to return an error message? Not sure yet. It is simpler to return false for now.

Should we combine server ip and port/tid into a single tuple, the socket address?

Revise random string generator to include all bytes of data, not just printable characters.
