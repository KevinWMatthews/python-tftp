Add server retries to test list.

For block number failure in client read:

# print 'Received wrong block number! Expecting 1 but got %s' % block_number
The block number is an unprintable character. How can I display the hex code?

Misc:

# There is something funky with the list of arguments. I have to create it all at once with the tuples?

Do we want to try to verify the console output of client read failures? Probably not.
Do we want to return an error message? Not sure yet. It is simpler to return false for now.

Should we combine server ip and port/tid into a single tuple, the socket address?

Revise random string generator to include all bytes of data, not just printable characters.
